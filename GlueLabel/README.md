This assignment looks at the inspection of bottles of glue to ensure that labels have been attached and are not crooked.

My program performs fully and correctly identifies the status of each glue label. I gaussian smoothed the image 
and made a bit easier to identify edges by adjusting the brightness of the images. I also experimented with
equalizing the histogram. Canny was used for the edge detection. I think it worked out quite well.
